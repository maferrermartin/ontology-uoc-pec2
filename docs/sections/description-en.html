<span class="markdown">An ontology containing the constructs on Qatar and Ryanair airline reviews.

The ontology aims to be a common framework to unify the terms, classes, properties and relationships on the lexicon, words or expressions for the classification and scoring of airlines.
It will be sought that users, when having to search for information about the quality of a conduit, have a developed ontology that facilitates and improves the experience in searching for data in this regard.

Two CSV files from two different airlines (Qatar and Ryanair) containing the ratings given by customers will be used to create the ontology. The objective will be to obtain a common framework that allows obtaining the maximum quantity and quality of information from both formats, unifying criteria and concepts that serve as a common framework for both formats.

Competency Questions:
• What does a user value to classify the quality of a flight?
• Which airplanes get the best or worst ratings?
• What complaints are the most common?
• What destinations are most frequent?
